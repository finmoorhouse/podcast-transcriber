      "{'transcript': \"\\nSpeaker 0: Hey, this is Here This Idea and in this episode I spoke with Jacob Trofeathern, who oversees Open Philanthropy's science and science policy programs. Open Philanthropy is a philanthropic thunder, which I would describe as being unusually serious about researching and identifying causes where funding is likely to help people the most. And in this episode, we spoke about global health research and development. So when I think about philanthropy or charity funding in the context of global health, I normally think about things like, you know, humanitarian aid or just direct public health spending on things like malaria nets or distributing diet supplements or vaccines. But vaccines and life saving drugs are health technologies.\\n\\nOften, they're really quite advanced technologies and, like, we all saw how it was only possible to spend money on buying up and distributing vaccines for COVID once we actually had some kind of demonstrably safe vaccines in the 1st place. Right? Same with smallpox, you know, smallpox vaccines and innovations in how to deliver and transport them and store them. That all meant that smallpox is now eradicated and 100 of millions of lives have been spared from smallpox since. So if you care about global health, then you might also start to think about ways to support research and development.\\n\\nAnd, of course, that's especially true for diseases which mostly affects the world's poorest people since those diseases see much less r and d spending relative to their health burdens compared to diseases where there's just a lot of demand for those products which treat or prevent or diagnose them. That all said, it was really not clear to me what global health r and d looks like at all or even how to support it and that's exactly what Jacob spends most his time thinking about. So we talked about prospects for a TB and strep a vaccine, monoclonal antibodies for malaria and even bugs that stop the spread of malaria. How much money gets spent on r and d for neglected diseases as a share of all health related r and d. How a drug or vaccine goes from initial developments to getting approved and getting distributed.\\n\\nPolicy tools and reforms for the FDA and the drug approval process, which could really accelerate drugs for neglected diseases without costing taxpayer money, why there isn't a kind of give well for global health r and d, lessons from operation warp speed, and also how global health r and d might compare in cost effectiveness terms to direct interventions like, you know, malaria nets or also frontier r and d aimed at economic growth primarily, and a whole lot more besides. So without further ado, here's Jacob Trefetham. Jacob Trefethen, thanks for joining me.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: So we're gonna be talking about global health r and d. But I guess, first of all, how do you describe what you do? Like, if you're at a party and someone asks you, what's what's the answer?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: So I am a program director at Open Philanthropy, and I work on giving away about a $100,000,000 a year with half a dozen colleagues to biomedical science. And we have a tilt towards global health r and d, so science and product development that might help people around the world, not just in the US where we're based, and, mostly give away the money of Dustin Moskovitz and Carrie Tuna.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Gotcha. And I think a big reason I wanted to talk to you was this blog you recently started, and it started with this post on health technologies, which probably won't exist in 5 years. Maybe a place to start is TB and TB vaccines. So I know, what should I know about TB as a disease, first of all?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: TB is a fascinating disease because there's so much we don't know about it, even though it's such an iconic disease that's, you know, coevolved with us for millennia at least, and and is, it still kills over a 1000000 people every year. And, you know, there aren't that many things that kill over a 1000000 people every year. There's maybe 60,000,000 people die every year around the world. So TB is really, on its own, doing a huge amount of damage. It's caused by bacteria.\\n\\nThose bacteria can stay dormant for many years in your body. Most of the time if you're infected with TB, it doesn't cause a problem. So, you know, it's contested how many people around the world are latently infected, but probably 100 of millions. And for most of those people, it's gonna be okay. But, if you get pulmonary disease, so disease in the lung, it can, kill you.\\n\\nAnd what else is known is that it's a disease intimately related to nutrition and to immune deficiency. So we're gonna talk a lot about probably new technologies in in this discussion, but it's probably worth talking a bit about nutrition, which is a boring technology of food where, you know, there's a recent study in a state in India called the Ration Study, that gave people who had TB disease rations or, you know, I think it was 1200 calories of food a day for 6 months along with some micronutrients. And so everyone in the study got that if they had TB, but then their household contacts of that person with TB were randomized into a treatment arm and a control arm where the treatment arm so, you know, think if you got kids and you live with who don't yet have TB, but, you know, are at risk, the treatment arm would get, I think it was 750 calories of of food and and, you know, some micronutrients for 6 months as well. And it's a really striking result that, in the treatment arm, there was 40% less instance of TB, 50% less TB disease, or I think it was pulmonary disease specifically.\\n\\nAnd that's that's quite something. That's, you know, that's a vaccine right there\\n\\nSpeaker 0: in the sense of Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: If you if you just had a better nutrition in some low and middle income countries, it would help people a lot already. So maybe I'll put that front and center, before we get into the technology. But, I mean, it's it's striking as well what we don't know about TB as I set up top. So I'm gonna just say some of the things that bug me all day. So how many people are latently infected?\\n\\nI said, it's Yeah. It's contested. So I've always gotta be careful if I say we don't know because often that's I don't know. But I'll the things I'm gonna mention are at least contested between researchers, and I'm not a TB researcher. So how many people are latently infected?\\n\\nKatherine Wu at The Atlantic had a really good piece going over this maybe 9 months ago or something. The statistic you'll see if you Google it that gets bandied around is that a quarter of people around the world, 2,000,000,000 people That\\n\\nSpeaker 0: was what I read on the bus. Yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So that's probably false. That's probably an artifact of how we've done the extrapolation from from tests, and it's probably 100 of millions, but quite how many not not really well known. Subclinical TB. So that was latent TB where you don't have any clinical symptoms.\\n\\nThere's sort of a gradation. There's before you have before you sort of have a persistent cough maybe or a coughing blood or having fever, night sweats, you might have might not know you have TB, but if you did an X-ray, your lungs would look not so great.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: And so there's this pretty contested notion of subclinical TB that's not latent. It's not full on TB. What really is it? And, you know, people are debating how you should define that, but also how much did it contribute to transmission? I don't think that's well known.\\n\\nYou know? Is is it the case that almost all spread is happening from people who you would guess, or is there a lot of people who don't have symptoms necessarily but are contributing to spread? Another one, I mean, just with modern tools, we now know a lot more about the function of different genes in in the bacteria and and the proteins they code for. And there's there's 4,000 genes in that bacteria, and, you know, we don't even know what all human genes do yet.
